The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
— against — Ind. No. 473-2010
Juan Caceres,
Defendant-Appellant.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This is an appeal from a judgment rendered on April 13, 2011, by the Supreme
Court, New York County. Juan Caceres was convicted after trial of one count of rape in
the second degree, N.Y. Penal Law § 130.30(1), one count of endangering the welfare of
a child, N.Y. Penal Law § 260.10(1), and one count of criminal contempt in the second
degree, N.Y. Penal Law § 215.50(3). He was acquitted of predatory sexual assault against
a child, N.Y. Penal Law § 130.96. Mr. Caceres was sentenced to seven years' imprison-
ment and 10 years' post-release supervision on the rape count and one year on the mis-
demeanor counts, all to be served concurrently.
Justice Carol Berkman provided over the pre-trial hearing. Justice Bruce Allen pre-
sided over the trial and sentencing. Timely notice of appeal was filed. No stay of execu-
tion has been sought.
ivQUESTIONS PRESENTED
1. Where the prosecution introduced highly prejudicial testimony regarding an
uncharged allegation of sexual abuse from the complainant without a hearing as to its
admissibility, was Mr. Caceres's right to a fair trial violated?
2. Where, in summation, the prosecution vouched for the credibility of its wit-
nesses and shifted the burden of proof onto Mr. Caceres, including by characterizing
Mr. Caceres's defense as that of a conspiracy to frame him, was Mr. Caceres's right to
a fair trial violated?
3. Where the complainant gave inconsistent, contradictory, uncorroborated, and
implausible testimony as to the alleged offenses, and admitted to repeatedly falsifying
allegations of abuse against her parents over many years, were the verdicts for second-
degree rape and endangering the welfare of a child against the weight of the evidence?
1INTRODUCTION
Juan Caceres's conviction resulted from only the latest in a series of false allega-
tions of abuse by the complainant, Vanessa Barrientos, against her parents. The Ad-
ministration for Children's Services (ACS) had repeatedly investigated the complain-
ant's false allegations from 2002 to 2009. These fabrications included the complainant
saying that her parents had beaten her with a hammer when in fact she had been bit-
ing herself, and that her mother had tried to smother her with a pillow and broken her
nose. In this case, the complainant's spurious allegations escalated. She claimed that
her father, Mr. Caceres, had engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with her, be-
ginning when she was in the sixth grade.
Mr. Caceres's convictions for rape in the second degree, endangering the wel-
fare of a child, and criminal contempt in the second degree must be reversed and a
new trial ordered. First, the trial court should have granted defense counsel's motion
for a mistrial after the prosecution elicited testimony from the complainant about an
uncharged allegation that Mr. Caceres had touched her vagina in an elevator years pri-
or to the charged incidents. This was a blatant violation of the prohibition that evi-
dence of uncharged crimes may not be introduced without a hearing to determine
whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. The trial court properly
concluded that this testimony should have been excluded but denied the defense's
motion for a mistrial, offering to strike the testimony instead. This remedy could not
have cured the extremely prejudicial effect of this testimony, but instead would have
2only reminded the jurors of the inflammatory testimony. The prosecution then capi-
talized on the violation by focusing on this improperly admitted testimony in summa-
tion.
Mr. Caceres was also deprived of a fair trial when, during summation, the pros-
ecution repeatedly vouched for the credibility of its witnesses and shifted the burden
of proof to Mr. Caceres. In particular, the prosecution repeatedly argued that Mr. Ca-
ceres could only be acquitted if he proved that there was a conspiracy to frame him,
concocted by the complainant's family, the police and the District Attorney's Office.
It also indicated that the jury must conclude that prosecution's witnesses were lying to
acquit Mr. Caceres.
Moreover, this Court should find that the verdicts for second-degree rape and
endangering the welfare of a child were against the weight of the evidence because the
complainant's testimony was simply not credible. Mr. Caceres was convicted of sec-
ond-degree rape based on the complainant's testimony that he had sex with her in
January 2010, but her testimony about this event was inconsistent with the account
she gave when she first reported the allegations. The complainant also alleged an on-
going course of sexual abuse prior to January 2010, which was the basis of Mr. Ca-
ceres's conviction for endangering the welfare of a child. But, unsurprisingly given her
admitted pattern of false accusations against her parents, her testimony was often im-
plausible, contradictory, or refuted by other evidence. Significantly, there was no phys-
ical evidence to corroborate her claims.
3STATEMENT OF FACTS
A. Juan Caceres was charged with several counts of sexually abusing his
daughter.
1. Mr. Caceres's Background.
Before his arrest in this case, Juan Caceres was a major organizer for
CECOMEX, a non-profit community organization that worked with the Mexican
community of New York City. T. 296, 389, 912.1 The organization was staffed largely
by volunteers. T. 898, 900. CECOMEX assisted community members with many is-
sues, including landlord-tenant, employment, immigration, or business-related mat-
ters. T. 295-97. CECOMEX maintained an office on 110th Street in Manhattan at the
time of Mr. Caceres's arrest, T. 53, 188-89, and previously maintained an office on
116th Street. T. 164, 335.
2. Charges and Pre-trial Proceedings.
On February 1, 2010, Mr. Caceres was indicted with one count of predatory
sexual assault against a child, one count of rape in the second-degree, one count of
criminal sexual act in the second-degree, and one count of endangering the welfare of
a child. See Indictment No. 473-2010 (hereinafter, “Indictment”). These charges
stemmed from allegations by his daughter, Vanessa Barrientos, that he had engaged in
oral sex and sexual intercourse with her beginning in 2007, when she was 11 years old,

4until January 2010. See Indictment at 1-2; T. 81 (complainant's date of birth is October
18, 1995). The charge of second-degree rape in the indictment alleged a single act of
sexual intercourse with the complainant “on or about January 9, 2010.” Indictment at
1. Mr. Caceres was also charged with criminal contempt in the second degree for al-
legedly violating an order of protection barring him from communicating with the
complainant's mother, Carmen Barrientos.2 See Indictment at 3; People's Exh. 3.
Prior to trial, the court held a Molineux hearing at which the prosecution moved
to introduce recanted allegations of abuse made by Sharon Caceres, Mr. Caceres's
other daughter. VD. 33-47. The court denied the prosecution's application. T. 65.
B. Trial.
1. The Complainant's Testimony.
a. The Complainant Alleged a Course of Sexual Abuse with Many
Contradictory or Inconsistent Details.
At trial, the complainant testified that, as of 2008, she, her mother, and her old-
er siblings Usenia and Oliver Barrientos, and Mr. Caceres, all shared a one-bedroom
apartment at 402 East 92nd Street in Manhattan. T. 84, 88, 99-101, 403, 656. Mr. Ca-
ceres typically shared the apartment's bedroom with Carmen Barrientos. T. 269; 697.
Mr. Caceres was not a part of the complainant's early childhood; she remembers first
meeting her dad when she was approximately four years old, and he moved in perma-
nently when the complainant was in sixth grade. T. 91-92, 97.
2 Both the complainant and her mother Carmen have the same last name. Thus, to avoid confusion,
Vanessa Barrientos is referred to as “the complainant” and her mother as “Ms. Barrientos.”
5The complainant testified that Mr. Caceres's sexual conduct with her initially
began when he showed her a pornographic movie around when she was in the fifth
grade, and later escalated to him performing oral sex on her. T. 103-17, 126, 132-34.
She testified that her father began having sexual intercourse with her on a regular ba-
sis at the end of the summer before seventh grade. T. 145-46. She said that sexual in-
tercourse with him became like a “basic routine” occurring almost every weekend. T.
148, 167. She claimed that he would have sexual contact with her usually in the living
room of the apartment around midday. T. 105, 145, 338.
The complainant also claimed that Mr. Caceres had sex with her in the
CECOMEX offices during the daytime, starting in “the summer of sixth grade,” first
by bringing her with him to the 116th Street office, then later to the 110th Street office.
T. 164, 166. She testified that the 110th Street office consisted of two rooms, with no
door separating the front room from the back room, only a hallway. T. 336-37. The
complainant also testified that many people came and went from the office, including
members of the public who sought assistance from CECOMEX. T. 296-97. The
complainant also testified that members of the organization frequently brought their
children to the office. T. 294-95.
The complainant said that Mr. Caceres always used condoms. T. 156. She said
he kept them in a black bag that also contained “sex movies,” vibrators, and lubricant.
T. 158-59. She said Mr. Caceres stored the black bag in his car. T. 345. She testified at
one point that the condoms were black-labeled NYC condoms. T. 151, 261. The
6complainant said she had seen the NYC condoms in a box in the CECOMEX office
before, and that CECOMEX gave them out for free to teenagers. T. 153-54, 367-68,
370. But on cross-examination, she admitted that she told police that Mr. Caceres had
used Trojan brand condoms that he had purchased from Duane Reade. T. 368. She
also later contradicted her statement that the condoms had been kept in a black bag in
the car when she instead said that they were kept in a cabinet or a drawer. T. 365.
The complainant also claimed that on one occasion Mr. Caceres took her and
her half-sister Sharon to a hotel for a night. T. 171. She said that Mr. Caceres pur-
chased alcohol for them and that she and Sharon both got drunk. T. 173. She said that
she did not remember what happened, but the next morning she woke up naked and
her sister was on the bed asleep. T. 174-75. She said that she vomited repeatedly in the
car on the way home. T. 175.
The complainant testified that after this incident, she did not drink alcohol. T.
393. However, on cross, defense counsel showed her a photograph in which she was
holding a beer bottle that she had posted on her MySpace account. T. 393. The com-
plainant then said that, on that occasion, she had asked her father if she could have a
beer and he allowed her to. T. 393-95. She said that she had “two sips.” T. 394.
The complainant also testified that her father kept pictures of her without
clothing on his computer at CECOMEX, on a USB drive, and on a CD. T. 182-83,
428-29, 444-45.
7b. The Complainant Had Repeatedly Fabricated Allegations of
Violent Abuse Against Her Parents in the Past
The complainant admitted to having a longstanding habit of making up claims
that her parents had abused her. This behavior occurred on multiple occasions be-
tween 2002 and 2009.
In 2002, the complainant told staff at her school that her parents had beaten
her with a hammer. T. 311-13. She had marks on her arm that presumably appeared
to be injuries. Id. When she was taken to the doctor to be examined, the doctors real-
ized that the marks were self-inflicted bite wounds. T. 312. At trial, the complainant
admitted that she had “made the whole story up.” T. 315. She said she had lied be-
cause she was upset that her father wanted her to do her homework and got angry
when she did not. T. 315.
The complainant admitted engaging in similar behavior in 2003. During her tes-
timony she acknowledged that she made up an allegation on September 4, 2003, T.
316, although she was not questioned about the details. The complainant justified her
lies by saying this behavior was the result of having “made mistakes” because she was
“little.” T. 320.
But she again made false accusations in 2009 when she was approximately 14
years old. Then, the complainant's guidance counselor reported “an incident involving
[the complainant's] parents to [ACS],” and “as a result, they came to [her] home to
investigate[.]” T. 323. Defense counsel referred to a document that apparently refer-
8enced the complainant's allegation that her parents were drinking excessively and us-
ing drugs, although the complainant denied those specific allegations on the witness
stand. T. 322-25. But she admitted that an investigator came to her home in Decem-
ber 2009 to inquire about something she told her guidance counselor about her par-
ents. T. 322-23. She then told the investigator that there were no problems in her
household, that she had “kind parents” whom she “enjoyed being with,” and she
made no mention of abuse. T. 323-24. She then spoke privately with the investigator
at school the next day after being pulled out of class, and again denied any abuse by
either parent. Id.
On direct examination, the complainant admitted that, also in 2009, she lied to
her neighbor and said her mother had tried to smother her by putting a pillow over
her face and had broken her nose. T. 140-41. She testified that she did not know why
she made up the story. T. 140. However, on cross-examination, when defense counsel
referred to ACS documents documenting this incident, she suddenly denied telling
anyone her mother put a pillow over her face. T. 317-18.
The complainant also testified that she had told an ACS investigator that on
one occasion Mr. Caceres drove home from a party drunk, with the complainant, her
siblings, and her mother in the car. T. 323, 325-26. She said that her mother made him
pull over and they walked home. T. 326. But her mother, who would later testify, de-
nied recalling any such incident. T. 745-46.
9c. The Complainant's Testimony Contradicted Her Statements to
Police and Medical Personnel About the Alleged Incident of
Sexual Intercourse with Mr. Caceres in January 2010.
The complainant testified that the last time Mr. Caceres had sex with her was
on January 10, or January 11, 2010. T. 232. She said she remembered that it was a Sat-
urday and that “it was a week before Martin Luther King Day.” T. 232. The com-
plainant also claimed to recall specific details of the day Mr. Caceres last had sex with
her and the days immediately thereafter. She said that she initially refused to have sex
with him, but eventually capitulated after he agreed that it would be the last time he
would touch her. T. 235. But she said that after they had sex, he nonetheless contin-
ued to touch her on the vagina “like almost every day,” “whenever he could[.]” T.
236-37.
She testified that the last time Mr. Caceres touched her vagina was January 17
in the CECOMEX office. T. 237. When asked how she knew it was on January 17,
she insisted, “Because I remember.” T. 237. The complainant testified with specificity
about this incident. She said that she was using the computer in the office when Mr.
Caceres went to get a drink of water and then “came like right behind me and then he
like covered – Like he leaned over and he like tried – Like he touched me.” T. 238.
She said that he touched her on the vagina, after which she leaned forward and “cov-
ered [her]self.” T. 237-38. She said that she was angry after this incident because her
father had promised he would not touch her after January 10. T. 238. The complain-
ant said that a few days later, on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, she told her mother
10“like the main parts like my dad had sexual intercourse with me.” T. 239. The com-
plainant's mother took her to Metropolitan Hospital to be examined, after which the
hospital referred her to a Child Advocacy Center. T. 258-59.
d. A Report of a Medical Examination at Metropolitan Hospital
Contradicted the Complainant's Testimony About the Last In-
cidents of Sexual Contact.
The prosecution introduced into evidence a report from Metropolitan Hospital
dated January 20, 2010—thus right after the complainant told her mother that Mr.
Caceres had sexually abused her. See People's Exh. 2. According to the report, the
complainant said that the “most recent episode” of abuse “was just after 1/1/10 and
was exclusively vaginal intercourse; [the complainant] denies anal intercourse or any
other forms of assault.” People's Exh. 2, “Chart Review Print” dated June 28, 2010,
Initial Consult OB/GYN MD Consult dated Jan. 19, 2010 at 1. The same report con-
tains a note dated January 20, 2010 saying the complainant said that the “last assault
[was a] ‘few days after New Year[']s.'” Id. at 2 (quotation in original). A few pages lat-
er, another note dated January 19, 2010 states that the complainant claimed that “yes-
terday when she was in her pyjamas her biological father touched her private parts.”
People's Exh. 2, “Chart Review Print” dated Jan. 18, 2010, ED MD Initial Note dated
Jan. 18, 2010 at 1.
11e. The Complainant Alleged That Mr. Caceres Emailed Her an
Erotic Story in English About Incest, But Gave Contradictory
Details Relating to When It was Sent and How She Received It.
The complainant also testified that in December 2009, her father emailed her
stories about father-daughter incest to her Yahoo e-mail account. T. 183-84. She said
that she deleted two of the stories after Mr. Caceres directed her to, but “got distract-
ed and [] forgot to delete” the third one. T. 184-85. The complainant said that she
was in the CECOMEX office when her father sent the email she forgot to delete, and
that just before he sent it, he “said, oh, I'm sending you an email.” T. 433. It “popped
up right then and there,” and she “read it right there, when the email came.” Id. She
said this occurred in the daytime, “like, early afternoon, somewhere around, after like
midday.” Id. She said that her reaction after reading it was that she “looked over at
[Mr. Caceres] and I'm like, really, why did you send this to me; he was just like, it was
something to read.” T. 434.
A printout of the email was introduced into evidence. See People's Exh. 30,
Printout of Email dated Dec. 2, 2009. It indicated that it was sent from the email ad-
dress soloparejas@msn.com and was sent to dominimexgirl@yahoo.com. Id. The
name of the sender was listed as “Pepe y Karolina.” Id. Although the complainant had
said it was sent and received in the middle of the day, the exhibit indicated that the
email had been received at 12:56 AM. Id. The email's subject line was “Read This”
and it told a story, which spanned several pages and was entirely in English, of a fa-
ther engaging in incestuous sexual acts with his daughter. Id. But earlier the complain-
12ant had testified that Mr. Caceres speaks only Spanish with her. T. 340. When asked,
the complainant agreed that Mr. Caceres speaks “a little broken English, but that's
about as far as it gets[.]” T. 340.
John Forames, a forensic analyst who searched CECOMEX computers, later
testified that internet search terms “solo parejas has [sic] MSN dot com” had been
typed in on a computer at the CECOMEX offices. T. 954. Although other references
to that email address had been found on the CECOMEX computers, Mr. Forames
said that there was “not really enough information” to know how or why the refer-
ences had appeared. T. 956.
Tracy Ingle, the senior director of outreach for global criminal compliance for
Microsoft, testified that the registration name associated with soloparejas@msn.com
was “Pepe y Karolina,” the name of the sender of the email. T. 616, 632; People's
Exh. 30. The phone number associated with the account was 917-912-3877, T. 620,
which had no apparent connection to Mr. Caceres. According to the complainant, Mr.
Caceres's phone number was 347-397-0366. T. 249. Additionally, the MSN.com ac-
count registration information listed the subscriber's birthdate as August 3, 1969. T.
632. Mr. Caceres's date of birth is April 13, 1967. Crim. Compl. at 2.
f. The Prosecution Solicited Testimony About the “Elevator Inci-
dent” and the Court Denied the Defense's Motion for a Mistri-
al.
During the complainant's direct testimony, the prosecutor asked her whether
Mr. Caceres had “ever touch[ed] you on your body in a way that you didn't like[.]” T.
13136. She responded that when she was eight years old, Mr. Caceres had touched her
“in my private area” while they were in an elevator and he was “kind of drunk[.]” T.
136. She claimed that she told her mother about the incident but that her mother
dismissed it. T. 137-40. She claimed that the authorities became involved later, after
she told her downstairs neighbor “Peaches” about the incident. T. 137. She said that
officials came to her house and “talk[ed] to me about what I had told Peaches, and
like they put me in a bedroom and they were checking for bruises and stuff.” T. 137.
Afterward she was taken to the hospital and “interrogated,” at which point she re-
canted the allegation. T. 138. She said that she recanted because her mother did not
believe her and she wanted her mother to stop being angry with her. T. 139-40; see also
T. 139 (testifying that she “got in trouble with mom” for “telling lies to people”).
It was this during portion of her testimony that the complainant admitted to
having lied to authorities about her mother breaking her nose by smothering her with
a pillow. T. 139-40. The complainant testified that while her allegation involving the
pillow was a lie, her claim that her father had touched her inappropriately in an eleva-
tor was true. Id.
After the complainant testified about the elevator incident, defense counsel
moved for a mistrial, noting that the prosecution never made a Molineux application to
admit this testimony about an uncharged crime. Defense counsel argued that the tes-
timony “greatly prejudiced” Mr. Caceres. T. 177. The prosecution argued that the tes-
timony was not subject to Molineux because it was “being offered to explain
the rela-
14tionship between the defendant and the witness,” and to “explore the clear credibility
issues that the defense has already raised from the beginning of this trial.” Id. The trial
court reserved decision on the mistrial motion. T. 177-78.
The next day, defense counsel supplemented their3 mistrial motion by citing to
several cases that show that a limiting instruction could not sufficiently cure the prej-
udice caused by the admission of the inappropriate testimony. T. 206-10 (citing People
v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350 (1981); People v. Fleegle, 295 A.D.2d 760 (3d Dep't 1992);
People v. Intelisano, 188 A.D.2d 881 (3d Dep't 1992); People v. Barranco, 174 A.D.2d 343
(1st Dep't 1991)). Relying on these cases, counsel also argued that a mistrial was even
more appropriate given that the “elevator incident” had been in the jurors' minds
overnight. T. 209-10. “It's now been sitting in this jur[y's] minds for the last twelve
plus hours, or more,” counsel noted, “that this is actually an ongoing [sic] pattern that
this defendant has a propensity.” T. 210.
Counsel also contended that the prosecution was well aware that they were go-
ing to ask the complainant about this incident and, by not including it in their pre-trial
Molineux application, they “did so at their own peril.” T. 209-10. Counsel further stat-
ed that the prejudice to the defense from the testimony could not be “overcome” giv-
en that the elevator incident allegedly occurred three years before the events at issue at
trial. T. 210.
3 Mr. Caceres was represented by two attorneys.
15The prosecutor argued that the incident was not introduced to show Mr. Ca-
ceres's propensity towards sexual abuse, but rather that the complainant was credible.
T. 212. She argued that the complainant's mother's disbelief as to the elevator incident
explained why the complainant waited so long to report her father's abuse for the
charged offenses. T. 212.
The prosecution also noted that the defense had failed to object to the testi-
mony at the time that it was given. T. 211. Defense counsel responded that they had
been shocked when they heard the testimony and did not know what the complainant
was talking about. T. 215-16; see also T. 217 (“[W]e were just shocked[.]”); T. 220
(same).
Finally, the parties disputed whether the ACS records that had been provided
to the defense as part of discovery included information of the elevator incident.
While the prosecution claimed that they did, T. 211-12, 218, both defense attorneys
emphatically claimed that the elevator incident was not mentioned in the records. T.
216-17, 219-20.4
The court ruled that the elevator incident “should not have been admitted be-
cause we should have had a pretrial proceeding concerning that testimony.” T. 220.
But it denied the defense's motion for a mistrial and instead offered to strike the tes-
4 After the court issued a ruling on the mistrial motion, the prosecution noted that an ACS report
dated September 4, 2004 said that “the father has touched the child in her vaginal area for sexual
gratification.” T. 222. Defense counsel noted that there was no mention of this occurring in an ele-
vator or of the complainant telling her mother about this incident. T. 222-23.
16timony and to give a curative instruction to the jury “not to speculate and to disregard
that testimony.” T. 220. Defense counsel declined this remedy, explaining that they
feared that striking the testimony would preclude them from cross-examining the
complainant about the incident. T. 221-22. They also argued that they did not believe
the court's remedy would cure the error because “it's very hard for [jurors] to remove
things from their mind, once it's been placed in their mind, and especially given a case
which has such strong emotions as the one which is before this particular jury.” T.
221. Defense counsel thus renewed the motion for a mistrial, which the trial court
again denied. T. 222-23.
2. Expert Testimony Regarding an Examination of the Complainant
Did Not Corroborate the Complainant's Account.
Both the prosecution and the defense called experts to testify about a physical
examination of the complainant performed at the Child Advocacy Center at Metro-
politan Hospital on February 1, 2010. See People's Exh. 1, Record of Examination at
Child Advocacy Center.
The prosecution called Dr. Jocelyn Brown, a child abuse pediatrician and pro-
fessor of clinical pediatrics, who had performed the examination. T. 474, 483. Despite
the complainant's testimony that her father last had sex with her as recently as a week
before Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Dr. Brown's examination found that the com-
plainant's hymen showed no signs of “acute or chronic trauma,” and she found no
vaginal bleeding or bruises. T. 492-93. Dr. Brown said she found an “indentation,” in
17the hymen, which was a “concavity or irregularity that doesn't go all the way down to
the base of the hymen.” T. 493. Dr. Brown testified that the indentation could either
be “normal” or it could be a sign of sexual abuse. T. 493-94. She testified that if the
hymen had suffered “blunt trauma,” it would result in a “transection.” T. 493. In that
case, there would be “not just an indentation but a complete cleft,” referred to as a “V
cleft.” T. 493. Having not examined the complainant previously, Dr. Brown said she
could not determine the reason for the indentation in her hymen. T. 494.
Dr. Gary Medows, a pediatrician who testified as an expert for the defense, also
testified that the complainant's hymen had a serrated edge and “slight depression.” T.
861. Like Dr. Brown, he testified that the depression could have been present from
birth since irregularities in the hymen can be “normal.” T. 861-62, 887, 890. Dr.
Brown stated that there was no such thing as a “virginity test,” because a high per-
centage of sexually active girls had been found to have a hymen that appeared to be
intact. T. 490. But Dr. Medows noted that these girls might not have experienced full
penetration, which could result in a change to the appearance of the hymen. T. 888.
He testified that “if somebody is having sexual intercourse with full penetration for a
long period of time, they will have damage to the hymen,” such as “a laceration” or
“stretching.” T. 888-89.
Dr. Brown said that her findings were consistent with a history of sexual abuse,
but she then suggested said that “consistent” and “conclusive” had essentially the
same meaning. T. 509-10. She suggested that this was because the inconclusive find-
18ings about the hymen could not be taken “in isolation,” noting that the complainant's
past reports of vaginal bleeding suggested sexual abuse. T. 504. Dr. Medows, howev-
er, testified that vaginal bleeding can have “numerous causes,” including an infection.
T. 865. Dr. Brown's testimony did not note any attempt to rule out other causes for
the reported vaginal bleeding.
Dr. Brown also noted that when she asked the complainant about “behavioral
or emotional symptoms,” the complainant said she was “not very hungry” at the time
of the examination. T. 486-87. Dr. Brown said only that she “looked into” whether
this indicated depression, but said nothing else about this. Id. Finally, Dr. Brown men-
tioned that the complainant did not report suicidal ideation, a symptom that “is com-
mon in a child having sexual abuse[.]” T. 486-87.
3. Detective Hernandez's Testimony.
Detective Hernandez of the New York City Police Department was the lead
investigator on the case. T. 68. He testified that he spoke to the complainant for ap-
proximately half an hour at Metropolitan Hospital on January 18, 2010, just after she
reported the abuse. T. 38-40. The next day, Detective Hernandez listened in (from a
separate room) as the complainant was interviewed by a forensic interviewer at the
Child Advocacy Center. T. 40-42. When asked by defense counsel whether he was
aware that the complainant alleged that Mr. Caceres had sexual intercourse with her
on January 4, 2010, the detective responded, “Yes. Right after New Year[']s.” T. 72.
19Detective Hernandez obtained search warrants for Mr. Caceres's apartment
and for the CECOMEX office at 110th Street.5 T. 46. At neither location did the po-
lice find any condoms or other contraceptives. T. 66-67. Additionally, the police
seized several hard drives, a laptop, some CDs, and papers; none of them contained
nude pictures of the complainant. T. 46, 53-54, 66-67.
During Detective Hernandez's testimony, the prosecution entered into evi-
dence 12 NYC condoms, which were still wrapped. See Photograph of People's Exh.
12. The detective said that he “receive[d]” these condoms on January 30, 2010 from a
forensic interviewer at the Manhattan Child Advocacy Center. T. 62-63. The condoms
were not recovered from any search. T. 62. Rather, Detective Hernandez was told that
they were given to the interviewer by the complainant. T. 62-63.
4. Carmen Barrientos's Testimony.
The testimony of Carmen Barrientos, the complainant's mother, was guarded
and unfocused, much of it relating to information about her family and her relation-
ship with Mr. Caceres. See, e.g., T. 686-89, 692-94 (several pages of discussion of the
time period prior to and just after complainant was born); T. 735-38, 741-47 (Ms. Bar-
rientos repeatedly stating that she does not remember information or does not under-
stand questions during cross examination); T. 703-14 (describing her reactions in the
days following the complainant's accusations in January 2010).
5 Det. Hernandez refers to the office address as “307 East 10th Street” here, however this is presum-
ably an error, as the elsewhere the address is referred to as 110th Street. See T. 53, 188-89.
20What her testimony did establish was that Ms. Barrientos married Mr. Caceres
in 2008, but he moved into her apartment with her and her children in 2001. T. 686,
694. The complainant said Ms. Barrientos's daughter Usenia had lived with her until
about 2008. T. 681-82. With Usenia living there, a total of five people, including the
complainant, her mother, Mr. Caceres and Oliver (Ms. Barrientos' son), lived in their
one-bedroom apartment. T. 697.
Ms. Barrientos testified that she did not see any signs of tension between Mr.
Caceres and the complainant, nor did she notice any signs of emotional disturbance,
such as “cry[ing] uncontrollably.” T. 735.
Ms. Barrientos stated that she never saw any “black bag” with vibrators and
other sexual paraphernalia in her or Mr. Caceres's car, as the complainant had de-
scribed. T. 747. However, she did testify that the items the complainant claimed the
black bag contained, such as sex toys and pornography, were kept in the house be-
cause Ms. Barrientos and Mr. Caceres used them in their sex life. T. 729-32.
Ms. Barrientos also said that it was she who had given the NYPD the condoms
the complainant claimed Mr. Caceres used to have sex with the complainant. T. 722-
23. These condoms also could have been seen by the complainant in the apartment
because Ms. Barrientos stated that she would often bring home boxes of condoms
from CECOMEX and send them to her mother, where “two young boys live.” T.
725.
21Ms. Barrientos claimed she did not remember the complainant's false allega-
tions that she was beaten with a hammer. T. 741. But she did remember another set
of false allegations made to ACS by the complainant, when she was in the fourth or
fifth grade. T. 766. Ms. Barrientos stated that “[ACS] would go to check because
Vanessa had told them – had told them a little lie that I had hit her and then because
of that they were seeing if the investigation, if it was true or not.” T. 766.
As mentioned above, Ms. Barrientos also did not recall an incident involving
her demanding that Mr. Caceres pull over because he was too drunk to drive, as the
complainant had described. T. 745-46.
5. Oliver Barrientos's Testimony.
Oliver Barrientos, the complainant's half-brother, lived in the apartment with
Mr. Caceres, the complainant, Ms. Barrientos (his and the complainant's mother), and
Usenia (his and the complainant's sister) when he first moved to the United States in
April 2008. T. 523, 527-28. He testified that on three occasions he came home early
from work to find the apartment's door locked with the chain, preventing him from
opening it. T. 532. Usually, he said, the door was locked with two security locks but
the chain was not used. Id. He said that on the first and third occasions, he saw Mr.
Caceres using the computer when he tried to open the door. T. 643-44, 648. On the
second occasion, Mr. Caceres opened the door wearing a towel, after which he went
into the apartment's bedroom for approximately 15-20 minutes. T. 647-48, 660. Oli-
ver said that he “didn't think much of the fact that [Mr. Caceres] opened the door in a
22towel.” T. 660. He also acknowledged that at the time, Mr. Caceres, Ms. Barrientos,
and the complainant all shared the bedroom, and that he did not see what the com-
plainant had been doing in the room T. 660-61. He also said that Mr. Caceres did not
seem surprised to see Oliver home at that time. Id.
6. Search of CECOMEX computers.
John Forames, a forensic analyst in the Computer Forensics Unit at the New
York County District Attorney's Office, testified that he had recovered data relating
to incest pornography from the CECOMEX 110th Street office computers. T. 928,
935-36, 939-40; see also T. 54-57 (computers given to NYPD Computer Forensic Unit
were all recovered from CECOMEX 110th Street office pursuant to search warrant).
He testified that he conducted a “keyword” search on a laptop and several hard drives
found in the CECOMEX offices. T. 939-40. The keywords included “Dominimex
girl,” “soloparejas,” and “incest.” Id.
Prior to his testimony, the defense moved to preclude the introduction of most
of the evidence introduced through Mr. Forames because the search results lacked
dates or times indicating when the files were created or accessed. T. 924-26; see Peo-
ple's Exhs. 47, 49. They argued that it was therefore impossible to know when the
pornography had been viewed. Id. Counsel also argued that this evidence was irrele-
vant and highly prejudicial. T. 924, 926. The prosecution responded that the defense's
arguments go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. T. 924-26. The court
agreed and denied the defense's application. T. 926.
23Mr. Forames testified that he found “nothing of significance” on most of the
media he searched. T. 934, 936, 938. Two computers, entitled “PC-2” and “PC-3,”
returned lists of files indicating that the computers had been used to search for incest
pornography. T. 941-48. On PC-2 and PC-3, the keyword search returned lists of files
showing that someone had conducted internet searches for incest pornography. PC-2
had a user account entitled “Juan,” but there was no other information to indicate
who had created the account. T. 975. PC-3 had a user account entitled “Juan Ca-
ceres,” which had the password “FISH.” T. 967. Mr. Forames said that a file showing
a search for “incest facts.com” was created on January 8, 2010, at 4:46:29 AM, and
was last accessed on January 14, 2010 at 3:16:27 AM. T. 943. This indicated the web-
site had been visited sometime between those two dates, but it was not possible to tell
exactly when. T. 943. Although there were many files referencing incest pornography
in the search results, this file was the only one on PC-2 with a corresponding date or
time. See People's Exh 47. The files from PC-3 were created or accessed between 2006
and 2009, but predominantly in 2008. See People's Exh. 49.
Mr. Forames did not provide in his testimony the complete list of keyword
searches he used. T. 939 (referring to multiple “set[s]” of keywords searched, but only
giving a few examples of search terms). He admitted that the report of the search re-
sults admitted into evidence was merely a summary of the original results of the
search. T. 981-82. He also did not “remember exactly how many keywords were
found on PC3[,]” T. 981, and also admitted that he deleted results he, his supervisors,
24and the prosecutors determined to be “false positives,” as well as those they did not
consider “relevant.” T. 981-82.
7. Witnesses Consistently Testified That the CECOMEX Offices
Were Small and Open to the Public, and That They Saw Nothing
Inappropriate Between Mr. Caceres and the Complainant.
Three people who frequented the CECOMEX office where Mr. Caceres
worked testified at trial: Maria Sanchez and Sandra Perez, two of the organization's
most frequent volunteers, and Dalia Tapia, Ms. Sanchez's daughter. T. 792, 794, 808-
09, 892-94. They testified that most volunteers had keys to the office, and they fre-
quently entered the office. T. 812, 900. The volunteers worked variable hours and
were not required to report to anyone or give notice when they went into the office.
T. 813, 923. Many volunteers brought their children with them. T. 794-95, 817-18,
899. Sometimes the organization's members arrived very early in the morning, late at
night, or on weekends, and several people often stayed overnight. T. 812, 818, 901.
Maria Sanchez explained that the office was very small, the door was usually wide
open, and one could see all the way to back of the office as soon as he or she stepped
in. T. 819-20.
Although the complainant claimed Mr. Caceres had sex with her in the middle
of the day in the CECOMEX office, T. 164, 166, 338, none of these witnesses testi-
fied to seeing anything inappropriate between Mr. Caceres and the complainant. Ms.
Sanchez never saw Mr. Caceres and the complainant alone together in the office. T.
828. Nor did she ever perceive any noticeable change in the complainant's behavior.
25T. 830. Dalia Tapia was friends with the complainant and saw her around the office
from time to time, including on the weekend. T. 794-95. She said that the complainant
never indicated that she was afraid of her father, nor did she seem depressed. T. 799.
Ms. Perez also noticed no signs of “problems or tension.” T. 903.
8. A CECOMEX Volunteer Habitually Used the Computers to Ac-
cess Pornography From 2008 Until September 2010.
Ms. Sanchez testified that everyone in the organization had access to the
CECOMEX computers, which were networked. T. 820-21. According to Ms. Perez,
although people tended to use the same computers, they were permitted to use
“[w]hatever computer was open, if anybody needed to use it they were able to use the
computer.” T. 901. Ms. Sanchez testified that a man named Eloy Ruiz, who often
slept in the office overnight, had been caught using the computers to search for por-
nography in the past. T. 822-24. Mr. Ruiz would “search a lot of it. Whenever he
would come in early in the morning.” T. 822. The pornography was “every kind of
different pornography,” including that which featured “horses.” T. 833. Mr. Ruiz
viewed so much pornography that computer viruses associated with it caused all the
computers in the office to freeze up. T. 822. Ms. Sanchez testified that Mr. Ruiz's
pornography habit peaked in 2008, but he continued to visit the office through Sep-
tember of 2010—months after Mr. Caceres's arrest. T. 825.
269. Summations.
During summation, defense counsel highlighted numerous reasons to doubt
the complainant's credibility. Counsel noted that the complainant had a long history
of fabricating complaints resulting in ACS investigations. T. 1003-04. Counsel argued
that the complainant was forced to lie about her allegations of sexual abuse against
Mr. Caceres because, unlike on previous occasions when she fabricated complaints
against her parents, her claims this time “ran ahead of her so fast, got out of control
so quickly, she couldn't retract it, so she became entrenched in this.” T. 1002. He ar-
gued that the complainant's knowledge about sex came from her having encountered
condoms, pornography, or other sexual materials around the apartment, rather than
abuse by her father. T. 1012-13.
Counsel also noted that Mr. Caceres is alleged to have sex with the complainant
at times and in places where he would have been easily caught, such as in the apart-
ment in the middle of the day when Oliver Barrientos would come home, or at very
busy times in the CECOMEX office. T. 1002, 1021-22. He noted that the complain-
ant's story about her father's drunk driving was not recalled by her mother, even
though the complainant said her mother was present during the incident. T. 1005. He
pointed out that that no black bag with sex paraphernalia was ever found, despite the
complainant's assertion that Mr. Caceres stored paraphernalia related to sex in it. T.
1012. Defense counsel also noted that Dr. Brown's testimony was, at most, equivocal
27about whether the examination of the complainant's hymen evidenced sexual penetra-
tion. T. 1026-29.
Defense counsel also highlighted the fact that the story about incest the com-
plainant claimed to have received by email was in English, including the subject line
“Read this,” even though Mr. Caceres speaks only broken English and everyone in the
family spoke Spanish with each other. T. 1016-17. He pointed out that the email indi-
cated that it had been sent near 1:00 AM, not in the middle of the day, as the com-
plainant had testified. T. 1015-16. Defense counsel also argued that Eloy Ruiz was
more likely responsible for the pornography-related files found on the CECOMEX
computers. T. 1017-19.
The prosecutor's closing argument primarily focused on establishing that the
complainant was credible. T. 1036. She pointed to the fact that Ms. Barrientos and the
complainant agreed on the date that the complainant told her mother that Mr. Caceres
had abused her, T. 1038-39, and to the complainant's demeanor while testifying. T.
1046. The prosecutor said that the question for the jury was “whether this [case] is a
big conspiracy between the Barrientos family, the police, and the District Attorney.”
T. 1035. She also stated that the jury had to decide “either that everybody is out to
frame [Mr. Caceres] in order to get something in return or Juan Caceres, the defend-
ant, actually committed these horrible crimes.” T. 1035.
The prosecutor also argued that the complainant should be believed because
she had not made more extreme accusations, such as claiming that Mr. Caceres beat
28her or threatened to kill her. T. 1062-63. She also told the jury to “think of some of
the things that you would expect to hear if this were a conspiracy,” such as the com-
plainant saying that Mr. Caceres “threatened to kill Oliver too if he told anyone [that
he came home to find the door chained and Mr. Caceres in a towel].” T. 1062-63.
The prosecutor also argued that the complainant “wanted to make up what was hap-
pening to her, she would have had an answer to everything.” T. 1048. Additionally,
the prosecutor said to the jury, “In your gut, you know it's the truth. You know it in
your head. You know it, you just know it.” T. 1045. The prosecutor also suggested
that the complainant had no motive to lie, saying that “what she gains is nothing”
from testifying. T. 1043; see also T. 1045 (prosecutor saying “[the complainant] gains
nothing from this.”).
The prosecutor also relied heavily on the “elevator incident”— which the court
had previously ruled should never have been admitted — to explain why the com-
plainant's testimony was trustworthy. T. 1052-53. She argued, citing this incident, that
Mr. Caceres had previously abused the complainant, but her mother did not believe
her because at “about nine years old she probably wasn't that articulate about what
was happening.” T. 1053. She said the complainant's later denial of the story was a
“false recantation.” T. 1053. The prosecutor told the jury that the elevator incident
“set the stage for her, for her father to take advantage,” because as a result of that in-
cident “[n]o one is going to ever to going to look at what she says and honestly think
that she's telling the truth.” T. 1053. The prosecutor also urged the jury to see “that
29history play[ed] out” in the charged crimes, and that it should use that history to figure
out whether the complainant was “telling the truth.” T. 1053-54.
The prosecutor also cleverly called attention to the fact that Mr. Caceres did
not testify. She said, “The last thing I want to touch on is that, although the defendant
didn't testify, absolutely his right. He did put on a case.” T. 1079.
10. Verdict.
The jury found Mr. Caceres not guilty of predatory sexual assault against a
child. T. 1128-29. They found him guilty of rape in the second degree, endangering
the welfare of a child, and criminal contempt in the second degree. Id.
C. Sentencing.
At the sentencing proceeding on March 1, 2011, the complainant and her
mother made statements, S. 3-7. Afterward, Mr. Caceres made a statement maintain-
ing his innocence. S. 12-18. The court then sentenced him to seven years' imprison-
ment followed by 10 years' post-release supervision on the second-degree rape con-
viction, to run concurrently with one year of imprisonment on the misdemeanor
counts. S. 18-19.
30ARGUMENT
POINT I
JUAN CACERES'S CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED
DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPLAIN-
ANT'S HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TESTIMONY THAT MR.
CACERES HAD SEXUALLY ABUSED HER YEARS PRIOR
TO THE CHARGED INCIDENTS.
A mistrial was the only appropriate remedy where the prosecution introduced,
without a pretrial hearing on its admissibility, the complainant's testimony about an
uncharged allegation that her father touched her vagina in an elevator several years
prior to the charged crimes. See People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 359 (1981); People
v. Gautier, 148 A.D.2d 280, 283-84 (1st Dep't 1989); People v. Barranco, 174 A.D.2d 343,
344 (1st Dep't 1991). The trial court properly agreed with the defense that the com-
plainant should not have been allowed to testify about these allegations because they
should have been subject to a Molineux hearing. T. 220-23. But the court abused its
discretion when it failed to grant a mistrial over defense counsel's strenuous objection,
instead offering to strike the testimony and give a curative instruction. Barranco, 174
A.D.2d at 344. As the defense argued, this remedy—offered a day after the testimony
was introduced—was insufficient to erase the highly prejudicial impact of the inad-
missible testimony. To the contrary, it would have just reminded the jurors of the in-
flammatory testimony. Thus, by denying the defense's request for a mistrial, the trial
court deprived Mr. Caceres his fundamental due process right to a fair trial. U.S.
Const. Am. XIV; N.Y. Const. Art. I, § 6.
31Evidence of uncharged crimes is generally inadmissible and cannot be admitted
solely to show the accused's propensity toward criminal conduct. People v. Molineux,
168 N.Y.2d 264, 313 (1901); People v. Resek, 3 N.Y.3d 385, 390 (2004). “The rule ex-
cluding evidence of uncharged crimes is based upon the human tendency more readily
‘to believe in the guilt of an accused person when it is known or suspected that he has
previously committed a similar crime.'” Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d at 359 (quoting
Molineux, 168 N.Y. at 313). Evidence of an uncharged crime is admissible only when it
is both relevant to a pertinent issue at trial (other than to establish a defendant's crim-
inal propensity), and the probative value of the evidence outweighs the risk of preju-
dice to the defendant. People v. Till, 87 N.Y.2d 835, 836 (1995); see also Resek, 3 N.Y.3d
at 389–90. The risk of undue prejudice is particularly great when the uncharged act is
“similar in nature” to the charged crime. People v. Foster, 295 A.D.2d 110, 113 (1st
Dep't 2002).
Because of the strong risk of prejudice, the accused is entitled to a ruling by the
court outside the presence of the jury to determine whether such evidence is admissi-
ble. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d at 361-62. It is improper for the prosecution to elicit the
testimony and wait for the defense to object. Id. If the prosecution introduces the tes-
timony without a hearing, there is not only a great risk of erroneous admission of the
testimony, but the accused is deprived of a fair trial “even if his objection is sustained,
in view of the questionable effectiveness of cautionary instructions in removing prior
crime evidence from consideration by jurors.” Id.
32A. A New Trial is Mandated Because the Prosecution Elicited Extreme-
ly Prejudicial Uncharged Allegations of Sexual Abuse From the Com-
plainant Without a Ventimiglia Hearing.
The risk of undue prejudice resulting from uncharged allegations of sexual
abuse is so great that if such testimony is improperly received, the remedy should be a
new trial. In People v. Gautier, 148 A.D.2d 280, 281-82, 285-88 (1st Dep't 1989), this
Court held that testimony that the defendant, who was accused of raping his two
daughters, had either raped or sexually abused them prior to and after the charged in-
cidents was inadmissible under Molineux. Recognizing that the testimony was prob-
lematic, the trial court had issued several limiting instructions sua sponte to the jury to
ignore the inadmissible testimony, but it denied the defense's mistrial motion. See id. at
287. Nonetheless, this Court reversed the conviction, finding that “the import of the
[inadmissible] testimony would not have been lost upon the jury.” Id. at 282.
Similarly, a new trial was ordered in People v. Fleegle, 295 A.D.2d 760, 761 (3d
Dep't 1992), where the defendant was charged with 31 counts each of rape, sodomy,
and sexual abuse of a minor girl. No hearing was sought by the prosecution to deter-
mine the admissibility of testimony that the defendant had begun abusing the com-
plainant years before the charged offenses. Id. at 762-63. Although there was no ob-
jection by the defense at trial, the Third Department found that the defendant's right
to a fair trial was violated by the prosecution's admission of the testimony without a
Ventimiglia hearing and without any limiting instructions from the lower court. Id. at
762; see also People v. Intelisano, 188 A.D.2d 881, 883-84 (3d Dep't 1992) (where defend-
33ant was charged with rape and the prosecution introduced testimony that he had beat-
en and choked the victim for months prior to the first charged offense, the lower
court's failure to conduct a hearing prior to admission of the evidence, as well as its
failure to give a limiting instruction, warranted reversal, even though the error was
unpreserved).
Additionally, this Court has held that a trial court abuses its discretion when it
fails to grant a mistrial after allowing the introduction of uncharged crime evidence to
remain unaddressed overnight. In Barranco, 174 A.D.2d at 344, the defendant was
charged with a drug sale and the prosecution conceded prior to trial that a police of-
ficer's testimony that he discovered 11 vials of cocaine in the lobby of the building
where the defendant lived was inadmissible under Molineux. Yet the officer nonethe-
less testified to discovering the vials. Id. Defense counsel immediately moved for a
mistrial, but the court reserved decision until the next day, when it denied the motion
and issued a curative instruction. Id. This Court held that the denial was an abuse of
discretion, noting that it was “particularly significant that the jurors had [the officer's]
testimony in their minds overnight before they were given the curative instruction to
disregard it.” Id. “Because the resulting prejudice was too great to be countermanded
by a curative instruction, it was an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's motion for
a mistrial.” Id. at 345.
Here, the prosecution's introduction of the complainant's testimony about the
alleged “elevator incident,” T. 216, was a flagrant violation of Molineux and Ventimiglia
34that mandates reversal and a new trial. Without seeking a hearing as to the testimony's
admissibility (even though it had requested a Molineux hearing related to other allega-
tions, VD. 33-47), the prosecution here elicited testimony from the complainant that
Mr. Caceres had touched her “in [her] private area,” T. 136-40, in an elevator when
the complainant was about eight years old. This alleged incident would have occurred
around 2003, about four years prior to the beginning of the first charged offense in
2007. See Indictment at 1 (alleging offenses began in 2007); T. 81 (complainant born
October 18, 1995).
Defense counsel moved for a mistrial following this testimony and the court
reserved decision until the next day. T. 177-78. The next day, defense counsel again
argued that the introduction of the testimony mandated a mistrial, citing Ventimiglia,
Fleegle, Intelisano, and Gautier. T. 206-10. Counsel noted that the court's decision to wait
until the next day to determine how to handle the admission of the highly prejudicial
testimony was especially problematic since the jurors sat with the inflammatory in-
formation overnight. T. 209-10.
The trial court ruled that the elevator incident should not have been admitted
because there should have been a pre-trial hearing to determine its admissibility. T.
220. But the court denied the defense's motion for a mistrial, instead offering to strike
the testimony and offer a curative instruction to the jury “not to speculate and to dis-
regard that testimony.” T. 220. Defense counsel declined this remedy, noting that the
35damage had already been done, and again sought a mistrial, but the court refused to
grant one. T. 220-23.
As the trial court properly concluded, Mr. Caceres was entitled to a hearing
outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the allegation that he had pre-
viously sexually abused his daughter was more any probative than prejudicial. He was
deprived of a fair trial when the prosecution completely disregarded this requirement,
surprising the defense during the complainant's testimony. T. 215-17, 220. Given the
extreme prejudice that inured to Mr. Caceres through the introduction of the testimo-
ny, a mistrial was the only appropriate remedy. See Gautier, 148 A.D.2d at 283-84; Flee-
gle, 295 A.D.2d at 761; Intelisano, 188 A.D.2d at 883-84.
The prejudice was compounded by the fact that, as in Barranco, 174 A.D.2d at
344, the trial judge offered to give a limiting instruction a day after the inadmissible
testimony was already heard by the jury. Indeed, the prejudice here is even greater
than it was in Barranco, since Mr. Caceres was accused not of selling a small amount of
drugs, but of raping his daughter multiple times over the course of several years. Any
suggestion that he had tried to touch the complainant inappropriately before the
charged incidents was extremely prejudicial, especially because the uncharged allega-
tion is “similar in nature” to the charged offenses. Foster, 295 A.D.2d at 113.
As counsel argued below, at best a curative instruction would have been use-
less, and at worst, it would have served only to remind the jury of the inadmissible tes-
timony. The Court of Appeals has recognized the “questionable effectiveness of cau-
36tionary instructions” when compared to the “human tendency more readily ‘to believe
in the guilt of an accused person when it is known or suspected that he has previously
committed a similar crime.'” Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d at 359-62 (quoting Molineux, 168
N.Y. at 313). Accordingly, defense counsel strenuously objected to the court's pro-
posal to instruct the jury to disregard the testimony, because “it's very hard for [the
jury] to remove things from their mind, once it's been placed in their mind, and espe-
cially given a case which has such strong emotions as the one which is before this par-
ticular jury.” T. 221. The nature of the accusations, along with the proposal of a cura-
tive instruction a day too late, ensured that “[n]o curative instruction could remedy the
prejudice which inevitably resulted from the jury hearing” the elevator incident testi-
mony. Barranco, 174 A.D.2d at 344-45. Only a new trial can correct the deprivation of
fundamental fairness that occurred here.
B. Admission of the alleged elevator incident testimony was far from
harmless.
The admission of the highly prejudicial testimony of an uncharged sex crime
was not harmless. As described in detail below, see Point III infra, the complainant suf-
fered from serious credibility issues that called the veracity of her entire account into
question. “The primary duty of the fact finder in this case was to determine whether
the victim's statements describing the incestuous act[s] charged in the indictment were
credible.” People v. Lewis, 69 N.Y.2d 321, 327-28 (1987) (ordering new trial after find-
ing that the error was not harmless where defendant was accused of incest with teen-
37age daughter and inadmissible Molineux testimony was introduced); see also Intelisano,
188 A.D.2d at 884 (holding that admission of uncharged crime evidence was not
harmless, where the case “turned heavily on issues of credibility”). This created a “se-
rious danger that the jury used [the elevator incident testimony] to draw the impermis-
sible inference” that Mr. Caceres “probably did it before, so he probably did it this
time too.” People v. Hudy, 73 N.Y.2d 40, 56 (1988) (uncharged accusations of sexual
molestation by one child, to bolster the allegations of eight other boys, were inadmis-
sible under Molineux and not harmless).
The Court especially should not find the error harmless since the prosecutor
capitalized on its egregious Molineux violation by highlighting it during summation to
make an argument about Mr. Caceres's propensity for sexual abuse. She argued that
the incident in the elevator “set the stage for her, for her father to take advantage,”
since her mother's reaction to the testimony made her think, “No one is going to be-
lieve her ever.” T. 1053. She further reminded the jury that the complainant insisted
during her testimony that the elevator incident was true. T. 1053. “It happened,” the
prosecutor argued. T. 1053. The prosecutor also relied on the elevator incident to ar-
gue that the jurors could conclude that the complainant was telling the truth when she
stated that “history play[ed] out” in the charged crimes. T. 1053-54. In other words,
the prosecutor argued that the complainant's testimony should be believed because
Mr. Caceres allegedly got away with a similar uncharged crime in the past. These were
clear appeals to Mr. Caceres's alleged propensity for sexual abuse to resolve the com-
38plainant's credibility problems; they cannot have been harmless because they “fall[]
within the core of what the Molineux rule prohibits and should therefore have been
excluded.” Hudy, 73 N.Y.2d at 56.
Further, the introduction of this testimony was not harmless because the testi-
mony lacked any probative weight due to its lack of substantiation. See Lewis, 69
N.Y.2d at 324, 327-28 (unsubstantiated testimony that complainant's father forced her
to have sex more than 10 times prior to the charged offense of incest was not proba-
tive because “a witness cannot buttress her own testimony by making further unsub-
stantiated accusations”). Since “the [complainant's] testimony was the principal evi-
dence of the crime,” it is not harmless to allow the complainant's alleged “cumulation
of defendant's criminal acts [to] seriously prejudice [the] defendant in the eyes of the
jury.” Id. at 328.
As in Lewis, the “principal evidence of the crime” was the complainant's testi-
mony, and the prosecution incorrectly argued that the unsubstantiated allegation bol-
stered her severely damaged credibility. Id. Therefore, the admission of the elevator
incident testimony was not harmless because the jury might have used it “to resolve
any doubts it otherwise might have had.” Hudy, 73 N.Y.2d at 56.
* * *
In sum, by denying the defense's request for a mistrial, the trial court allowed
the prosecution to, proverbially, have its cake and eat it too. The prosecution sur-
prised the defense with the introduction of this highly prejudicial testimony. Then it
39relied heavily on the testimony in summation, capitalizing on the defense's desire not
to have the court highlight the damaging evidence by striking it and issuing a limiting
instruction. Because the denial of the defense's motion for a mistrial violated Mr. Ca-
ceres' right to a fair trial, this Court must reverse his conviction. U.S. Const. Am.
XIV; N.Y. Const. Art. I, § 6.
40POINT II
JUAN CACERES WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL
WHEN THE PROSECUTION REPEATEDLY VOUCHED
FOR THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS WITNESSES AND AT-
TEMPTED TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO MR.
CACERES IN SUMMATION.
During her summation, the prosecution repeatedly engaged in misconduct. She
frequently vouched for the credibility of her witnesses and shifted the burden of
proof to the defense. These egregious instances of prosecutorial misconduct violated
Mr. Caceres' fundamental due process right to fair trial and require this Court's rever-
sal of his conviction. U.S. Const. Am. XIV; N.Y. Const. Art. I, § 6.
A. The Prosecution Repeatedly Vouched for the Credibility of Its Wit-
nesses During Summation, Depriving Mr. Caceres of a Fair Trial.
A defendant does not receive a fair trial when the prosecution vouches for the
credibility of the prosecution's witnesses in summation. People v. Collins, 12 A.D.3d 33,
37 (1st Dep't 2004) (citing People v. Bailey, 58 N.Y.2d 272 (1983)) (reversing defend-
ant's conviction in the interest of justice). This Court and others have repeatedly rec-
ognized that “the weight of the prestige of the office [of the District Attorney] and its
image of disinterestedness may impose upon a defendant's right to an impartial trial.”
Id.; see also People v. Ortiz, 33 A.D.3d 432, 433 (1st Dep't 2006) (conviction reversed in
the interest of justice where the “prosecutor repeatedly vouched for the credibility of .
. . two key witnesses with approving references to their status as law enforcement of-
ficials”); People v. Mehmood, 112 A.D.3d 850, 853 (2d Dep't 2013) (prosecutor imper-
41missibly vouched for the credibility of a witness based on his position as a law en-
forcement officer).
1. The Prosecution Impermissibly Argued That the Jury Could Only
Acquit Mr. Caceres If It Believed Law Enforcement and the Dis-
trict Attorney's Office Were Framing Mr. Caceres.
This Court held in Collins that a prosecutor may not vouch for its witnesses by
arguing that a defense could only be believed if all the prosecution witnesses were ly-
ing. Id. at 37-38. There, the prosecution had argued that the jury “could not believe
defendant's testimony that he was merely doing the undercover a favor by helping
him buy drugs unless it believed that all the undercovers were lying[.]” Id. The Court
reversed the conviction, finding that such vouching for the prosecution witnesses'
credibility “[e]xceed[ed] the bounds of legitimate advocacy.” Id. at 37; see also People v.
Forbes, 111 A.D.3d 1154, 1158-59 (3d Dep't 2013) (reversing where prosecutor's other
misconduct “pale[d] in comparison to his statement that [to acquit], the jury
had to
accept that there was a far-reaching conspiracy to convict defendant
,” which in-
cluded the prosecutor going along with every witness lying and required law enforce-
ment witnesses to risk their careers); People v. Jones, 134 A.D.3d 1588, 1589 (4th Dep't
2015) (reversing in the interest of justice where prosecution improperly characterized
the defense as being based on “a big conspiracy” against defendant by the prosecution
and its witnesses); People v. Roman, 150 A.D.2d 252, 255 (1st Dep't 1989), vacated by rea-
son of appellant's death, 153 A.D.2d 812 (1989) (prosecution improperly vouched for its
42witness by asking “Why would he come into Court and frame Antonio Roman
now?”).
In summation here, the prosecutor made a similarly problematic argument. She
told the jurors that they must decide whether there was a “big conspiracy between the
Barrientos family, the police and the District Attorney's office to concoct charges
against [Mr. Caceres].” T. 1035. And she further presented the jury with a dichotomy,
saying that “it's either that everybody is out to frame him in order to get something in
return or Juan Caceres, the defendant, actually committed these horrible crimes.” T.
1035.
These arguments improperly vouched for the credibility of the prosecution's
witnesses by implying that the jury should not believe that the District Attorney's of-
fice, together with the police, would get involved in a “conspiracy” to “frame” Mr.
Caceres. T. 1035. The prosecution's statement was an appeal to the “prestige of the
office,” and its “perceived disinterestedness.” Collins, 12 A.D.3d at 37-38; see also Jones,
134 A.D.3d at 1589. As they did in Collins and Jones, the prosecution's arguments here
deprived Mr. Caceres of a fair trial, requiring reversal.
2. The Prosecutor Vouched for the Credibility of the Complainant
Herself.
A prosecutor may not argue in summation that its witness must be telling the
truth because the witness had not made additional or more extreme accusations. Col-
lins, 12 A.D.3d at 37-38. In Collins, the prosecutor said that a police officer could not
43be lying because he did not make it “rock solid and really frame this defendant,” by
“plant[ing] drugs on him” or “plant[ing] money.” Id.; see also Roman, 150 A.D.2d at
256-57 (prosecution engaged in impermissible vouching for police officers by saying
that if they had intended to frame the defendant “they could have come up with a
gun; they could have put finger prints on it. They could have said he confessed. They
could have gotten more witnesses”).
In summation here, the prosecutor engaged in this misconduct. She argued that
if the complainant really wanted to frame Mr. Caceres, then “why not make it sound
like something you would hear at the movies,” such as that Mr. Caceres “smacked”
and “whipped” her, or that “he really did use the vibrators on her,” or threaten to kill
her or Oliver Barrientos. T. 1061-62. The prosecutor further argued that the com-
plainant's testimony would have been more consistent if she were lying, because if the
complainant “wanted to make up what was happening to her, she would have had an
answer to everything.” T. 1048. The prosecution also insisted that the complainant
had no motive to lie when she stated that by testifying, “what [the complainant] gains
is nothing. She gains absolutely nothing.” T. 1043. See also T. 1045 (prosecutor saying,
“[The complainant] has nothing to gain out of this. And so why did she come here?”).
Likewise, it is well settled that a prosecutor may not express his or her personal
belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence. Bailey, 58
N.Y.2d at 277; People v. McReynolds, 175 A.D.2d 31, 32 (1st Dep't 1991) (reversing in
the interest of justice where prosecutor offered personal assurance that the testimony
44produced was credible); People v. Pagan, 2 A.D.3d 879, 880-81 (2d Dep't 2003) (revers-
ing in the interest of justice where prosecutor repeatedly vouched for complainant's
credibility, stating that he was “candid” and being “forthright”); Forbes, 111 A.D.3d at
1158 (holding that the prosecutor's comment “He's telling the truth” during summa-
tion was “clearly impermissible”). In this case, the prosecutor vouched directly for the
complainant's credibility by insisting that the complainant must be telling the truth
because “[i]n your gut, you know it's the truth. You know it in your head. You know
it, you just know it.” T. 1045. Just as a prosecutor cannot suggest to the jury that the
complainant's testimony has a “ring of truth,” it is impermissible for her to argue that
a juror knows her testimony is true in their gut. See People v. Griffin, 125 A.D.3d 1509,
1510 (4th Dep't 2015) (reversing in the interest of justice because prosecutor repeat-
edly vouched for the complainant, including saying the [complainant's statements]
have “the ring of truth”). These additional instances of misconduct further demon-
strate that reversal is required.
B. The Prosecution Shifted the Burden of Proof Onto Mr. Caceres By
Arguing That the Jury Could Acquit Only If It Found That the Prose-
cution Witnesses Engaged in a “Conspiracy” or an Attempt to
“Frame” Him, and By Drawing Attention to the Fact That He Did
Not Testify.
“[I]nstructing the jury that in order to find a defendant not guilty it must find
that the prosecution witnesses lied is an impermissible attempt to shift the burden of
proof from the People to the defendant.” Collins, 12 A.D.3d at 38 (internal quotations
omitted); accord People v. Cantoni, 140 A.D.3d 782, 786-87 (2d Dep't 2016) (holding that
45it was “clearly improper and prejudicial” to argue or imply that jurors were required to
believe the defense testimony, and believe that prosecution witnesses were lying, in
order to form reasonable doubt, warranting reversal in the interest of justice); People v.
Porter, 136 A.D.3d 1344, 1346-47 (4th Dep't 2016) (citing People v. Morgan, 75 A.D.3d
1050, 1053-54 (4th Dep't 2010)) (reversing in the interest of justice where prosecution
shifted burden of proof by suggesting that an acquittal would require the jury to find a
conspiracy by law enforcement). A prosecutor also may not “attempt to shift the bur-
den by implying that the defendant has an obligation to introduce evidence.” Collins,
12 A.D.3d at 38; see also Ortiz, 116 A.D.2d at 532 (impermissible for prosecution to
imply that defendant had obligation to introduce evidence disproving complainant's
allegations); People v. Pugh, 258 A.D.2d 674, 675 (2d Dep't 1999) (citing People v. Bull,
218 A.D.2d 663, 665 (2d Dep't 1995)) (prosecutor in summation improperly shifted
burden of proof by arguing defendant had to prove that the complainant was mistak-
en and the investigating detective lied).
Here, the prosecution engaged in this same misconduct when it mischaracter-
ized Mr. Caceres's defense as one of a “big conspiracy” to “frame” him. These state-
ments deprived Mr. Caceres of a fair trial because they implied that Mr. Caceres had
failed to meet an obligation to introduce evidence in his defense. Collins, 12 A.D.3d at
38. See also T. 1062-63 (prosecutor telling the jury to “think of some of the things you
would expect hear if this were a conspiracy”). “The prosecutor erred...[by] implying
that the jury was entitled to acquit only if it disbelieved the evidence actually present-
46ed. The jury was, of course, also obligated to acquit if it found the evidence, even if
completely reliable, insufficient to establish each element of the crimes charged be-
yond a reasonable doubt.” People v. Levy, 202 A.D.2d 242, 245 (1st Dep't 1994).
Finally, the prosecutor also shifted the burden of proof when it sought to have
the jury draw a negative inference from the fact that Mr. Caceres had not testified. See
People v. Harte, 29 A.D.3d 475, 476 (1st Dep't 2006) (reversing where prosecutor “in-
vited the jury to ‘wonder why [defendant] chose not to testify'”). A prosecutor may
not rely on the “implication [that the] defendant failed to testify and thereby deprived
the jury of an opportunity to test [the defendant's] version of the story.” People v.
LaDolce, 196 A.D.2d 49, 54 (4th Dep't 1994). Here, the prosecutor stated during
summation that “[A]lthough the defendant didn't testify, absolutely his right[,] [h]e did
put on a case,” after having previously implied that his case was not sufficient to
prove the “conspiracy” against him. T. 1079. Although the prosecutor chose her
words carefully, there can be no doubt that they were intended to draw negative atten-
tion to Mr. Caceres's exercise of his right not to testify. There was no other reason for
the prosecutor to mention the fact that Mr. Caceres had not testified. This prosecuto-
rial misconduct is yet another reason for reversal.
C. Due to the prosecutor's egregious errors in summation, this Court
should reverse Mr. Caceres's conviction in the interest of justice.
The prosecution's numerous instances of misconduct in summation warrant
reversal and a new trial. Although defense counsel did not object to these statements,
47they were so egregious that this Court should reverse in the interest of justice, as
courts have done many times before. See McReynolds, 175 A.D.2d at 32; Ortiz, 33
A.D.3d at 432; Porter, 136 A.D.3d at 1346; Griffin, 125 A.D.3d at 1510; Jones, 134
A.D.3d at 1589; Forbes, 111 A.D.3d at 1158 n.6; Pagan, 2 A.D.3d at 880. Reversal in
the interest of justice is warranted where the misconduct “has caused such substantial
prejudice to the defendant that he
has been denied due process of law.” Griffin, 125
A.D.3d at 1511-12 (internal quotation omitted). Substantial prejudice occurs where, as
here, persistent and repeated “improper remarks pass without objection or admon-
ishment, and few curative instructions are given.” Id. at 1512 (quoting People v. Casano-
va, 119 A.D.3d 976, 979 (3d Dep't 2014)).
There is also a risk of substantial prejudice where a different result might have
been reached without the misconduct. Id. at 1511-12. As discussed below, Point III
infra, the complainant had severe credibility issues. Here, the prosecution's vouching
for the credibility of its witnesses and shifting the burden onto Mr. Caceres risked
causing the jury to resolve its doubts about the complainant's testimony in favor of
the prosecution. Thus, reversal in the interest of justice is warranted because these
“numerous” and “compounded” instances of misconduct allowed the prosecution to
escape the fundamental burden of proving Mr. Caceres's guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. Porter, 136 A.D.3d at 1346.
48POINT III
THE VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EV-
IDENCE BECAUSE THE COMPLAINANT'S TESTIMONY
WAS INCONSISTENT, CONTRADICTORY, IMPLAUSI-
BLE, AND UNCORROBORATED AND THEREFORE
WHOLLY INCREDIBLE.
Mr. Caceres's conviction turned entirely on the credibility of the complainant,
and she was simply not credible. The complainant admitted that she had repeatedly
made up serious allegations of abuse against both of her parents, indicating that she
was perfectly capable of making up allegations of sexual abuse against her father. T.
140-41, 311-25. That all of her allegations in this case were false is illustrated by the
fact that her testimony about the details of the last time her father had sex with her,
which she claimed was in January 2010, was contradicted by medical and police rec-
ords from when she first reported the allegations. Since Mr. Caceres' conviction for
second-degree rape—the only felony of which he was convicted—was for having sex
with the complainant in January 2010, see Indictment at 1, this Court should set aside
that verdict as against the weight of the evidence and dismiss the indictment. Like-
wise, because all of the complainant's testimony allegations were not credible, it
should set aside his conviction for endangering the welfare of a child.
This Court must review the weight of the evidence to determine whether,
“based on all the credible evidence, a different finding would not have been unrea-
sonable.” People v. Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d 490, 495 (1987); see also N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law §
470.15(5). “‘[E]ven if all the elements and necessary findings are supported by some
49credible evidence, the court must examine the evidence further.'” People v. Cahill, 2
N.Y.3d 14, 57-58 (2003) (quoting Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d at 495). As the Court of Appeals
has explained, “the weight of the evidence examination 
 requires[] the court to af-
firmatively review the record; independently assess all of the proof; substitute its own
credibility determinations for those made by the jury in an appropriate case; determine
whether the verdict was factually correct; and acquit a defendant if the court is not
convinced that the jury was justified in finding that guilt was proven beyond a reason-
able doubt.” People v. Delamota, 18 N.Y.3d 107, 116-17 (2011) (internal citations omit-
ted). When “the trier of fact has failed to give the evidence the weight it should be ac-
corded, then the appellate court may set aside the verdict.” Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d at 495
(citation omitted).
A. The Second-Degree Rape Conviction was Against the Weight of the
Evidence Because the Complainant's Testimony Contradicted the
Claims She Made to Police and Hospital Staff in January 2010.
New York courts have found verdicts in rape cases against the weight of the
evidence where the complainant gave testimony that was inconsistent with the ac-
count given at the time of the alleged offense. In People v. Zephyrin, 52 A.D.3d 543,
543-44 (2d Dep't 2008), the court found that the complainant's testimony alleging that
her husband raped her was “contradictory and incredible” because it “was not con-
sistent with what she told police officers on the day of the incident,” and there was no
other evidence to support the conviction.
50Likewise, the only evidence of the alleged rape in this case was the complain-
ant's contradictory testimony. Mr. Caceres was convicted of second-degree rape based
on the allegation that “on or about January 9, 2010,” he had sexual intercourse with
the complainant, who was 14 years old at the time. T. 1113 (jury charge); Indictment
at 1. But the complainant's testimony about her father's behavior in January 2010 con-
tradicted what she told medical staff and the police right when she first reported the
alleged abuse—in January 2010.
On the witness stand, the complainant claimed that her father last had sex with
her on January 10, or January 11, 2010. T. 232. When asked why she knew it was one
of these two dates, she said that she specifically remembered that it was a Saturday
and a “week before Martin Luther King Day.” T. 232. January 9, 2010 was a Satur-
day,6 which is likely why that is the date in the indictment.
However, the complainant's testimony at trial (and presumably to the grand ju-
ry) was contradicted by what she told the staff at Metropolitan Hospital who exam-
ined her right after she first reported the abuse. According to a report dated January
20, 2010, she said that the “most recent episode [of abuse] was just after 1/1/10 and
was exclusively vaginal intercourse; [patient] denies anal intercourse or any other
forms of assault.” People's Exh. 2, “Chart Review Print” dated June 28, 2010, Initial
Consult OB/GYN MD Consult dated Jan. 19, 2010 at 1 (emphasis added). The same
6 See “Calendar for January 2010,” timeanddate.com,
www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?year=2010&month=1.
51report reiterates that the complainant said Mr. Caceres last assaulted her a “few days
after New Year[']s.” Id. at 2. January 9, 10 or January 11 are significantly more than a
“few days” after New Year's.
Additionally, the complainant must have related a date much closer to New
Year's when Detective Hernandez was investigating her allegations. When asked by
defense counsel whether he was aware that the complainant alleged that Mr. Caceres
had sexual intercourse with her on January 4, 2010, the detective responded, “Yes.
Right after New Year[']s.” T. 72. Detective Hernandez interviewed the complainant
on January 18, 2010—the day she reported the abuse—and listened to a forensic in-
terview with the complainant at the Child Advocacy Center on January 19, 2010. T.
38-42. Therefore, his testimony further indicates that she had initially told officials in
January 2010 that that the last time Mr. Caceres had sex with her was right after New
Year's, likely on January 4.
A 14 year old can be expected to know the difference between “a few days af-
ter New Year's” (or January 4), and a week before Martin Luther King Day (or Janu-
ary 9, 10, or 11). In fact, the complainant testified at trial that she remembered in spe-
cific detail the final time that her father had sex with her. See T. 233-35 (testifying that
Mr. Caceres begged her to have sex and she acquiesced only after he said it would be
the last time). The discrepancy between her trial testimony and what she told officials
right after she reported the abuse shows that her story was false.
52In other words, the complainant's statements right after she reported the abuse
differed significantly from those she made on the stand. These discrepancies cannot
be explained away by lapses in memory. Rather, they reveal that the complainant's tes-
timony—and particularly with regard to any sexual act in January 2010—is untrust-
worthy.
As a result, this Court should set aside Mr. Caceres' conviction for second-
degree rape because “the jury failed to accord the evidence the weight it should have
been accorded.” See People v. Gonzalez, 84 A.D.3d 1400, 1401 (2d Dep't 2011) (revers-
ing conviction for endangering the welfare of a child based on sexual abuse allegations
because complainant was clearly found to be incredible and should have been acquit-
ted on all charges).
B. The Endangering the Welfare of a Child Verdict Was Against the
Weight of the Evidence Because There Were Numerous Reasons to
Believe That the Complainant's Testimony Was Entirely Fabricated.
1. The Prosecution Expert's Examination Was Inconsistent with the
Alleged Course of Sexual Abuse.
Courts have repeatedly reversed verdicts as against the weight of the evidence
where there is no medical evidence to support incredible testimony from the com-
plainant. In People v. Franco, 11 A.D.3d 710, 710-11 (2d Dep't 2004), the court held
that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence where the complainant testified
that she was “continually subjected to vaginal and anal intercourse,” but “the medical
evidence showed that she had an intact hymen with one discontinuity[.]” Id. The de-
53fense expert also testified that “her physical condition was inconsistent with that of a
young girl who had been repeatedly penetrated anally and vaginally by an adult male.”
Id. Another verdict convicting the defendant of sexual conduct against a child was
held to be against the weight of the evidence where there was “no medical evidence or
proof of social maladjustment to support the allegation that sexual acts occurred be-
fore the complainant was 11 years old[.]” People v. Otway, 71 A.D.3d 1052, 1053-55 (2d
Dep't 2010); see also People v. Madison, 61 A.D.3d 777, 778-79 (2d Dep't 2009) (revers-
ing rape verdict as against the weight of the evidence after noting that physical evi-
dence corroborating complainant's account was absent).
Here, the prosecution expert, Dr. Jocelyn Brown, examined the complainant
and found nothing to indicate that she had engaged weekly in sexual intercourse for
years, as the complainant claimed. The complainant testified that sexual intercourse
with Mr. Caceres was a “basic routine,” occurring almost every weekend. T. 148, 167.
But, as in Franco, 11 A.D.3d at 710-11, Dr. Brown found that her hymen had “no
acute or chronic trauma.” T. 492-93. The only notable finding was that the hymen had
an “indentation at [the] 6:00 [position].” T. 492-94. This indentation was a “concavity
or irregularity that doesn't go all the way down to the base of the hymen.” T. 493. Dr.
Brown testified that if a “blunt trauma” had occurred to the hymen, such as with pe-
nile penetration, typically one would find “not just an indentation but a complete cleft,
[which] we refer to as a V cleft,” which was not found. T. 493 (emphasis added). And
here, also as in Franco, the defense expert, Dr. Gary Medows, testified that with re-
54peated full penetration from sexual intercourse, the hymen would eventually rupture.
T. 888-89; see Franco, 11 A.D.3d at 710-11.
Both experts agreed that it was not possible to know the cause of the apparent
indentation in the complainant's hymen. Dr. Brown conceded that it could be “nor-
mal,” and it was certainly not proof of penetrating trauma. T. 504. She also testified
that “you may have concavity in the hymen of a teenager and that may be normal for
her.” T. 494. Likewise, Dr. Medows testified that the indentation could have been
congenital. T. 861-62.
The only other physical symptom the complainant reported was vaginal bleed-
ing on two occasions. T. 496-97. Dr. Medows testified that such bleeding can have
many causes, including infections or fibroids. T. 865. Dr. Brown also questioned the
complainant about emotional or behavioral systems. T. 486-87. The only finding she
reported was that the complainant said that she was “not very hungry” at the time of
the examination, T. 487, which could have been the result of any number of causes.
The complainant also denied suicidal ideation, a symptom which, according to Dr.
Brown, “is common in a child having sexual abuse[.]” T. 486-87.
The physical evidence here fails to corroborate the complainant's otherwise in-
credible account. The lack of a complete cleft or rupture to the hymen discredits the
complainant's claim that she had had sexual intercourse “every weekend” since the
summer before seventh grade. T. 145, 148. The lack of physical evidence that she was
“continually subjected to vaginal
intercourse,” combined with an absence of any
55clear indication of behavioral or emotional symptoms that would result from years of
sexual abuse further indicates that her account was false. Franco, 11 A.D.3d at 710-11;
Otway, 71 A.D.3d at 1053-55.
2. The Complainant Had a Long History of Falsifying Abuse Allega-
tions Against Her Parents.
This case also bears similarity to Madison, in which there was evidence of the
complainant's attempts to have rape allegations falsified. See Madison, 61 A.D.3d at
778-79 (instant messenger conversations showed complainant attempted to convince
another person to falsify allegations against defendant). This was not the first time
that the complainant had invented detailed—but false—claims that her parents had
severely harmed her, leading authorities to investigate. In 2002, she told staff at her
school that injuries to her arms resulted from her parents beating her with a hammer,
but it turned out that the complainant was actually biting herself. T. 311-13. At trial,
the complainant admitted that she had “made the whole story up” about being beaten
with a hammer. T. 315. She also admitted to falsifying allegations in 2003. T. 316.
And, yet again, in 2009, she told a neighbor that her mother had broken her nose
while trying to smother her with a pillow, but she admitted on the stand that the “pil-
low and the nose [allegation] was a lie and it didn't happen[.]” T. 140-41.
The complainant's mother also testified to other false allegations by the com-
plainant, and contradicted the complainant's claims. Ms. Barrientos recalled a period
56of regular visits from ACS to investigate “a little lie that [she] had hit [the complain-
ant]” that the complainant told around 2006 or 2007.7 T. 766.
The complainant's allegations caused ACS to investigate her family again in
December 2009, when she claimed her parents drank excessively. T. 323. On the
stand, the complainant denied specifically mentioning alcohol consumption, T. 323,
but her mother testified that ACS had come to investigate whether she drank exces-
sively. T. 741. The complainant admitted that when ACS came, she twice told investi-
gators that there was no abuse or inappropriate behavior, including when her parents
were not present with her and the investigator. T. 323-24. At trial, the complainant
may have found herself caught in another lie: Ms. Barrientos also did not remember
the incident the complainant described in which Ms. Barrientos forced Mr. Caceres to
stop driving because he was too drunk. T. 325-26, 745-46.
Although the complainant attempted to explain the 2002 incident as the prod-
uct of having “made mistakes” when she “little,” T. 320, this pattern of lies against
her parents spanned seven years and continued as late as December 2009—only a
month before she accused Mr. Caceres of sexual abuse. T. 323. Defense counsel
therefore rightly argued in summation that her allegations in this case were only the
latest escalation in long history of false accusations, but in this instance, the situation
7 Ms. Barrientos stated that the complainant told this lie when she was in fourth or fifth grade. T.
766. Since the complainant was in ninth grade at the time of the trial in 2011, this implies that the
complainant claimed her mother hit her in about 2006 or 2007. T. 1, 82.
57“got out of control so quickly, she couldn't retract it, so she became entrenched in
this.” T. 1002.
3. The Complainant's Testimony Featured Numerous Other Contra-
dictions and Lacked Corroboration.
When the complainant's testimony is uncorroborated, self-contradictory, and
inconsistent with other witnesses' testimony, courts have repeatedly set aside convic-
tions for sexual abuse and sexual assault as against the weight of the evidence. See Peo-
ple v. McMitchell, 110 A.D.3d 923, 923-925 (2d Dep't 2013) (complainants and their
mother gave “contradictory and inconsistent testimony,” including about details re-
garding circumstances of alleged course of sexual abuse by defendant, leading court to
find conviction to be against the weight of the evidence); Zephyrin, 52 A.D.3d at 534
(rape conviction was against the weight of the evidence where complainant's testimo-
ny contradicted testimony of police officers and her own earlier account); Otway, 71
A.D.2d at 1054-55 (conviction of course of sexual conduct against a child was against
the weight of the evidence where “the conviction rested solely on the credibility of the
complainant, and her testimony was inconsistent and not definite as to specific acts or
times of the alleged sexual assaults”); Madison, 61 A.D.3d at 778 (noting that com-
plainant's account not corroborated by other testimony or physical evidence and re-
versing as against the weight of the evidence); Franco, 11 A.D.3d at 710-11 (“Once the
trial court discredited the complainant's testimony, the record was devoid of any evi-
dence that the defendant made contact with the complainant ‘for the purpose of grati-
58fying sexual desire of either party.'”). Here, the complainant's testimony featured
many inconsistencies and contradictions both within her own testimony and with that
of other witnesses, and generally lacked corroboration.
The complainant claimed that Mr. Caceres had sex with her in places where
they could have been easily discovered, but in the several years she claimed Mr. Ca-
ceres abused her, this never happened. The CECOMEX office on 110th Street, where
the complainant claimed that Mr. Caceres had sex with her on multiple occasions,
consisted of two rooms with no door separating them, and one could easily see the
entire office upon entering. T. 336-37, 902. Volunteers often came and went from the
office without notice to Mr. Caceres, and worked variable hours including on week-
ends, late at night, and early in the morning. T. 812-13, 818, 901, 921-23. Yet, the
three witnesses who frequented the CECOMEX office testified that they saw nothing
that indicated anything inappropriate was occurring between Mr. Caceres and the
complainant. T. 794-95, 799, 828, 830, 903.
Likewise, in 2008, five people lived in the family's one-bedroom apartment, in-
cluding Mr. Caceres, the complainant, Oliver Barrientos, Ms. Barrientos, and Usenia
T. 88, 99-101, 403, 656. The complainant indicated the abuse occurred on a weekly
basis, almost always in the living room. T. 104-05, 148, 156, 167. Yet Ms. Barrientos
testified that she never noticed any signs of emotional disturbance in the complainant
nor any tension between Mr. Caceres and the complainant. T. 735.
59Oliver Barrientos testified that he once came home from work to find the
apartment door locked with the chain, after which Mr. Caceres opened the door wear-
ing a towel. T. 532. He said that Mr. Caceres and the complainant came out of the
bedroom and left the apartment approximately 15-20 minutes later. T. 647-48, 660.
But this occurrence did not indicate any sexual abuse. Mr. Caceres did not seem sur-
prised to see Oliver, who was coming home from work at the normal time. T. 660.
Mr. Caceres also shared the bedroom with the complainant and her mother at the
time, so it made sense that he would be in the bedroom. T. 661. Oliver also testified
that he did not see anything that occurred inside the bedroom, nor did he think much
of seeing Mr. Caceres in a towel. T. 660-61.
Moreover, just as the complainant's testimony contradicted her statements
from January 2010 about when Mr. Caceres last had sex with her, her testimony also
contradicted other details she gave to police in January 2010 about the alleged prior
course of abuse. The complainant first stated that Mr. Caceres used black NYC brand
condoms during sex, which she said the CECOMEX office gave out for free, T. 151,
153-54, but then admitted she told the police that he purchased Trojan condoms from
Duane Reade. T. 368.
The condoms in evidence the complainant claimed Mr. Caceres used were giv-
en to Det. Hernandez through a police interviewer by Ms. Barrientos, who found
them in her own car. T. 61-62, 723-24. But they may have been left there by Ms. Bar-
rientos herself, since she testified that she regularly sent condoms to her family in the
60Dominican Republic. T. 725. The complainant also first claimed that the condoms
were kept in black bag that was stored Mr. Caceres's car, T. 158-59, 345, but later in-
sisted that the condoms were kept in a cabinet or a drawer in the apartment, T. 365-
66. These inconsistencies reveal that she was making up details each time she was
asked, especially because no black bag was ever found. T. 66-69 (NYPD did not re-
cover any black bag after search warrants); T. 747 (complainant's mother never found
any black bag in the car).
The complainant also testified that she never drank alcohol prior to the inci-
dent where she claimed her father got her and her sister drunk at a hotel, and that she
never drank alcohol after it. T. 393. But defense counsel showed her a photo she had
posted to her MySpace account with her holding a beer. T. 393-94. She then admitted
that she asked her father if she could have it, and that she did drink from it. T. 394-95.
Furthermore, she testified that Mr. Caceres took nude pictures of her, and kept
vibrators, pornography and lubrication in the black bag in the car. T. 182-83, 428-29,
444-45. But Detective Hernandez obtained search warrants for the CECOMEX office
and Mr. Caceres's apartment and found no nude pictures of the complainant on any
of the digital media that were seized, nor did he find any black bag with sexual para-
phernalia. T. 46, 53-54, 66-69.
The Metropolitan Hospital report contradicted the complainant's testimony as
well. According to the report, the last incident of sexual assault was sexual intercourse
a “few days after New Year[']s.” People's Exh. 2, “Chart Review Print” dated June 28,
612010, Initial Consult OB/GYN MD Consult dated Jan. 19, 2010 at 2. But the com-
plainant testified that after Mr. Caceres had sex with her on January 10 or 11, he con-
tinued to touch her on the vagina “like almost every day,” “whenever he could,” until
January 17, 2010. T. 236-37.
During her testimony, the complainant claimed to recall specific details about
this persistent touching, none of which she reported to Metropolitan Hospital. For
instance, she said that on January 17, in the CECOMEX office, Mr. Caceres touched
her vagina by reaching over while she was sitting in a chair at a computer. T. 237-38.
She said that was she angry that he had promised he would stop, but he had not, after
which she told her mother about Mr. Caceres's abuse. T. 238-39. But the medical re-
port contains a note saying that the complainant was seen on January 18 and that she
claimed that “yesterday” [i.e., on January 17] Mr. Caceres touched her while she was
“in her pyjamas.” People's Exh. 2, “Chart Review Print” dated Jan 18, 2010, ED MD
Initial Note dated Jan. 18, 2010 at 1. Thus, her testimony and the medical note con-
tain different sets of facts about the same event. Namely, she did not mention being
in her pajamas on the witness stand (nor is it likely that she wore her pajamas to the
CECOMEX office).
624. Other Evidence Regarding Files Related to Incest Pornography
Searches and an Email Mr. Caceres Allegedly Sent to the Com-
plainant Lacks Connection to Mr. Caceres and Must Be Disre-
garded.
a. Incest Pornography Search Files Could Have Resulted From
Eloy Ruiz's Long-Term, Habitual Use of the Office Computers
for Pornography.
Although the prosecution entered a forensic report listing files that indicated
the CECOMEX office computers had been used to search for incest pornography,
these files likely came from another volunteer, Eloy Ruiz. T. 822-24. Mr. Ruiz had
been repeatedly caught using the CECOMEX computers to view pornography
“whenever he would come in early in the morning.” T. 822. Mr. Ruiz had been using
the computers for pornography since at least 2008, and he worked at CECOMEX un-
til September 2010, overlapping with the period that the complainant claimed Mr. Ca-
ceres sexually abused her by several years. T. 825.
Tellingly, the majority of the files had no dates or times associated with them.
See People's Exh. 47, 49. The files that did have dates or times were consistent with
Mr. Ruiz's use of the computers. See People's Exh. 49 (dates and times associated with
files occurring late at night or early in the morning, and largely between 2007 and
2009); T. 825 (Mr. Ruiz's pornography habit was at its height in 2008). There was also
nothing to indicate who was actually using the computers when the files were created.
T. 972 (forensic analyst testifying that it was not possible to tell how many different
people had access to various user accounts on CECOMEX computers).
63Although the search files showed specific references to incest, the volunteer
Maria Sanchez observed that Mr. Ruiz was interested in “every kind of different por-
nography,” including perverse or extreme kinds of pornography, such as that which
featured “horses.” T. 833. Furthermore, the forensic analyst may have deleted any-
thing that could have distinguished between users. Mr. Forames admitted that a larger
list of keywords had been generated as a result of the search, and he, in conjunction
with the prosecution and his supervisors, deleted what they did not consider “rele-
vant.” T. 981-82. Thus, the list of files in evidence may have been tailored to appear as
though it resulted from someone specifically interested in incest, when it actually re-
flects only a subset of Mr. Ruiz's interest in “every different kind of pornography.” T.
833.
The complainant also claimed that Mr. Caceres sent her an email relating a sto-
ry about father-daughter incest, but there was no evidence that the email address be-
longed to Mr. Caceres. The sender email address was soloparejas@msn.com. See Peo-
ple's Exh 30. The name of the sender, and the name registered with this address was
“Pepe y Karolina.” People's Exh. 30; T. 632. The phone number registered with the
account was not Mr. Caceres's. See T. 620 (phone number registered with account was
917-912-3877); T. 249 (Mr. Caceres's phone number is 347-397-0366). The MSN.com
account registration information listed the subscriber's birthdate as August 3, 1969. T.
632. Mr. Caceres's date of birth is April 13, 1967. Crim. Compl. at 2. Nothing showed
that Mr. Caceres had ever used the address. T. 956 (some references to email address
64appeared on CECOMEX computers but forensic analyst could not determine what
they meant).
Significantly, the email and its subject line were entirely in English. See People's
Exh. 30. Yet, the complainant testified that Mr. Caceres conversed with her only in
Spanish, and speaks only a “little broken English.” T. 340.
Second, the complainant claimed that she received the email “like, early after-
noon, somewhere around, after like midday.” T. 433. She said Mr. Caceres told her he
was sending her an email, and then he sent it. T. 433. The email then “popped up
right then and there,” and she “read it right there, when the email came.” T. 433. Yet
the email indicated that it was received in the middle of the night, at 12:56 AM. See
People's Exh. 30.8
In sum, this Court should deem unpersuasive the evidence relating to the
CECOMEX computers and the email that the complainant claimed she received from
Mr. Caceres. While they were highly prejudicial, they were not probative because the
8 There was some confusion introduced by the prosecution as to whether 12:56 AM really meant
5:56 AM or 8:56 PM the previous day, since other printouts of information related to the time the
email was received showed the timestamp as “5:56:00 GMT -500.” See T. 1016 (defense counsel ex-
plaining timestamp, refuting the prosecution's earlier suggestion that the email was received around
9 PM). GMT refers to Greenwich Mean Time. See “UTC – The World's Time Standard”, time-
anddate.com, www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html. An email sent from the Eastern Stand-
ard Time Zone (EST) will have the time zone listed as “-0500” in the header of the email, which
indicates that Eastern Time is 5 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. See “EST – Eastern Standard
Time / Eastern Time (Standard Time)”, www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/est. 5:56 AM Green-
wich Mean Time would therefore be 12:56 AM Eastern Standard Time. Accordingly, a screenshot of
the complainant's email account and the printout of the email itself shows that the email was re-
ceived at 12:56 AM. See People's Exhs. 30, 45E, 45F. In any case, the time stamp did not show that
the email was received in the “early afternoon” or “right after midday” as the complainant claimed.
T. 433.
65prosecution did not show any link to Mr. Caceres. Indeed, they could only have mis-
directed the jury from the complainant's severe lack of credibility.
As a final note, the jury acquitted Mr. Caceres of predatory sexual assault on
the basis of the same incredible testimony that supported his charges for second-
degree rape and endangering the welfare of a child. Courts have repeatedly found ver-
dicts to be against the weight of the evidence when the same incredible testimony
supporting the charges the jury acquitted on were the sole basis for the charges the
jury convicted on. See People v. Fisher, 104 A.D.3d 868, 869-70 (2d Dep't 2013) (“Once
the jury discredited the complainant's testimony with respect to the charges of rape
and criminal sexual act, the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant
‘knowingly act[ed] in a manner likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral
welfare of a child
.”); Otway, 71 A.D.3d at 1053-55 (jury had acquitted defendant on
numerous related counts of child sexual abuse, indicating that the complainant was
wholly incredible); Gonzalez, 84 A.D.3d at 1401 (verdict was against the weight of the
evidence on several counts where same incredible testimony supported acquittal on
three other counts); Franco, 11 A.D.3d at 710 (guilty verdict against the weight of the
evidence where “[i]t [was] clear that the trial court acquitted the defendant of the nine
remaining sex offenses based on the credibility of the witnesses”).
The verdicts convicting Mr. Caceres of second-degree rape and endangering
the welfare of a child were therefore against the weight of the evidence. This Court
should set aside these verdicts and dismiss those charges of the indictment.
66CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court must reverse Mr. Caceres's conviction
and order a new trial, or in the alternative, this Court should set aside the verdicts for
second-degree rape and endangering the welfare of a child as against the weight of the
evidence and dismiss those charges of the indictment.
